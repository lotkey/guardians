C.D.
Cade will work on all things weapons. This includes any weapon that the player will pick-up and use.
Because weapons will be valuable in the game, we split this into its own feature as the game will have a miriad of
weapons that can get stronger and stronger as the game progresses.
Examples include but are not limited too: Cool guns, swords, bombs, bow and arrows, random objects that do alot of damage, etc.

Cade will colaborate with Garret, who is heading the Inventory feature, so that these two separate, but related
features will work together smoothly.

In terms of inheritance, the weapons class might have children like melee, ranged, or explosive.
Or in other ways, it might inherit from, say, interactable objects in the game.
