This directory will contain/contains Assets from Ryan.

I will be creating the enemy entities for our game, along with working on their AI so they know how to move around and attack the player.

Ideas:
- All Enemies
   - Default: Walk towards player until in attacking range.
- Grunt
   - Make a trigger zone in a cone or rectangle in front of the grunt and have a slashing animation play whenever the player walks in that area and take damage.
      - could also just make the trigger zone a circle surrounding the grunt.
- Tanky Boi
   - 2x Health compared to grunt.
   - moves slower
   - hits harder
- Ranged/Sniper
   - no trigger zone around enemy
   - shoots projectiles for damage.
   - strafe for a 0.5 seconds before shooting again
