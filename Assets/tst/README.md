# Guardians/Assets/tst/
This folder will contain the test files for the project. Each team member will have their own folder to place edit mode and play mode test files in.

## Test Requirements
Each team member must have the following minimum tests in the project:

1. Define at least one **stress test** case and add it to the groupâ€™s stress tests. Each stress test must define a failure condition. The stress test should start at a success position, then gradually increase the stress until a failure is detected. It should then return the value where the failure occurred.

2. Create at least 2 initial **boundary tests** for the automated testing system that your team lead will set up. Be purposeful in your testing. Think about your boundary conditions.

_**Note:**_ All tests must be fully automatic and not require user input except to start the test case. Each test case must return a clear pass fail (or a failure point for stress tests).

The QA manager is responsible for tying all the tests together, whatever that means, but each team member must come up with their own test.
